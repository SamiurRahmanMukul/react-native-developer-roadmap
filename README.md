# React Native Developer Roadmap

A comprehensive guide for becoming a proficient React Native developer, including key concepts and technologies to study.

---

## 1. JavaScript

### A. ES6+ Features

- `let`, `const`, arrow functions, destructuring.
- Promises, async/await.
- ES6 Modules: `import`, `export`, template literals, rest/spread operators.

### B. JavaScript Concepts

- Closures, scopes, event loop.
- Prototype chain, `this` context.
- Callbacks and promises in event-driven architecture.

---

## 2. TypeScript

### A. Basic TypeScript Syntax

- **Primitive Types**: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `any`, `unknown`, etc.
- **Type Inference**: Let TypeScript infer types.
- **Union & Intersection Types**: Master type flexibility.

### B. Typing React Components

- Function components with typed props.
- Typing `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`.

### C. Typing Hooks

- Focus on `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useContext`.

### D. Events, APIs, & Libraries

- Ensure event typing and API typings with `Axios`, `Fetch`.
- Redux and React Navigation typings.

---

## 3. React Fundamentals

### A. JSX

- Understand how JSX works and its differences from HTML.

### B. Components

- Functional and class components.
- Props vs. State management.

### C. Hooks

- Core hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`.
- Custom Hooks for abstracting complex logic.

### D. Component Lifecycle

- Class lifecycle methods and hooks lifecycle (`useEffect`).

---

## 4. React Native-Specific Concepts

### A. Environment Setup

- React Native CLI for project initialization (Expo for simpler projects).

### B. Core Components

- Master `View`, `Text`, `ScrollView`, `TextInput`, `FlatList`.

### C. Styling

- Flexbox for layout.
- Libraries: `Styled-Components` or `Tailwind CSS`.

### D. GlueStack UI

- Learn UI libraries to speed up development.

### E. Handling Input & Forms

- Forms, validation libraries like Formik and Yup.
- Touch and gesture handling.

### F. Native APIs

- Camera, GPS, other native modules.

### G. Platform-specific Code

- Use the `Platform` module for managing differences between iOS and Android.

---

## 5. State Management

### A. Context API

- Use Reactâ€™s native context for small apps or local state management.

### B. Redux Toolkit

- Core concepts: State, Action, Reducer, Dispatch.
- Middlewares: Redux Persist, Redux Thunk, Redux Saga, RTK Query, custom middleware.
- Use Redux DevTools for debugging.

---

## 6. Mobile App Architecture

### A. Component Design

- Modular and reusable component design (Atomic Design).

### B. Folder Structure

- Organize your project efficiently (e.g., feature-based or domain-driven).

### C. Data Flow

- Embrace unidirectional data flow in React.

---

## 7. React Native Navigation

### A. React Navigation

- Stack, tab, and drawer navigation.
- Passing data between screens.

### B. Deep Linking

- Handle external app URLs or deep linking integrations.

---

## 8. Working with Native Code (Optional but Useful)

### A. Native Modules

- Integrating native code (Java for Android, Objective-C/Swift for iOS).

### B. Bridging

- Communicate between JavaScript and native code for custom native modules.

---

## 9. Debugging & Testing

### A. Debugging Tools

- React Native Debugger, Flipper, Chrome DevTools.

### B. Testing

- Unit Testing: Jest or Vitest.
- Component Testing: React Native Testing Library.
- End-to-End Testing: Detox or Appium.

---

## 10. Performance Optimization

### A. Optimizing Re-renders

- Memoization techniques (`React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`).

### B. Handling Large Lists

- Efficient list rendering with `FlatList` or `SectionList`.

### C. Native Modules for Performance

- Offload CPU-intensive tasks to native modules if necessary.

---

## 11. Deployment

### A. App Store & Play Store

- Building, signing, and deploying apps for iOS and Android.

### B. OTA (Over-The-Air) Updates

- Use CodePush for seamless updates without App Store approval.

---

## 12. Popular Libraries in React Native

### A. UI Libraries

- Explore `NativeBase`, `React Native Paper`, `React Native Elements`.

### B. Networking

- API calls with `Axios` or native `fetch`.

### C. Async Storage

- Understand Async Storage for persistent local storage.

### D. Push Notifications

- Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or React Native Push Notification library.

---

## 13. Advanced Concepts (Optional but Beneficial)

### A. Animations

- Learn React Native Reanimated for smooth animations.

### B. Advanced Features

- Bluetooth, NFC, Payments, and more depending on the app requirements.
